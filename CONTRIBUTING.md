## üìù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Include system information**:
   - OS and version
   - Shell type and version
   - Azure CLI version
   - Error messages with full stack trace

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check existing feature requests** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the feature request template**
3. **Explain the use case** and expected behavior
4. **Provide examples** of how the feature would be used

### Contributing Code

#### Types of Contributions We Welcome

- **Bug fixes** - Fix reported issues
- **New features** - Add new ADO CLI commands or functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve existing docs or add new guides
- **Cross-platform support** - Improve Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility
- **Test coverage** - Add or improve test scripts
- **Performance improvements** - Optimize existing functionality

#### Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch from dev**
   ```bash
   # Start from the dev branch (default branch)
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   
   # Create your feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style and conventions
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Test your changes on multiple platforms if possible

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Test installation
   ./INSTALL.sh  # or .\install.ps1 on Windows
   
   # Test core functionality
   ado setup
   ado --help
   ado list
   
   # Test your specific changes
   # Add any specific test commands for your feature
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: brief description of changes
   
   - Detailed explanation of what was changed
   - Why the change was necessary
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes
   
   Fixes #issue-number"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request to dev branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
   **Important**: All pull requests should be submitted against the `dev` branch, not `main`. 
   The `main` branch is protected and only the repository owner can merge to it.

#### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for Epic work item creation

fix: handle special characters in work item titles

docs: update installation instructions for Windows 11

refactor: improve error handling in ado-integration.sh
```

#### Branching Strategy

We use a three-branch workflow:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code. Protected branch, only repository owner can merge.
- **`staging`** - Pre-production testing. Used for release preparation.
- **`dev`** - Active development. **Default branch for all pull requests.**

**Workflow:**
1. Contributors create feature branches from `dev`
2. Pull requests are submitted to `dev` branch
3. Repository owner merges `dev` ‚Üí `staging` for testing
4. Repository owner merges `staging` ‚Üí `main` for releases

**Branch Protection:**
- `main` branch requires pull requests and prevents direct pushes
- All CI checks must pass before merging
- Only the repository owner (@abbeyseto) can approve merges to `main`

#### Code Style Guidelines

**Shell Scripts (Bash):**
- Use 4-space indentation
- Include error handling with `set -e`
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use color coding for user output
- Follow existing function naming patterns

**PowerShell Scripts:**
- Use PascalCase for function names
- Use approved verbs (Get-, Set-, New-, etc.)
- Include parameter validation
- Use Write-ColoredOutput for consistent formatting
- Handle errors gracefully

**Documentation:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Update table of contents if needed
- Test all commands and examples
